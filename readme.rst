There are two sides of the system, the restaurant side and the customer side. The restaurant side has the control over the User Management module, Reports module, and Menu Management module, while the customer side has the Order module. Once the customer’s mobile device is connected to the restaurant’s Wi-Fi connection, the Order Module will automatically show itself. The Order module allows the customers to manage and choose the food they desire and will allow them to order food without falling in-line in front of the cashier. After ordering, the system will then automatically generate a Quick- Response code that is to be scanned by the waiter/cashier. The code that was generated by the system will only last for 3 hours for it to be scanned, after 3 hours the code will be auto-canceled or expire. This is for the customers who decided to order outside or far from the restaurant. Once the code is generated, the customer can no longer edit/change his/her order. However, once the code is scanned by the cashier, the cashier can still edit the customer’s order manually.
